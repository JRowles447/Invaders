# Invaders
This repository is an implementation of the Invaders game based on the Udemy course [Ultimate Rust Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/?referralCode=AF30FAD8C6CCCC2C94F0) that includes step-by-step instructions.

Invaders is an open source terminal arcade game with audio, based off of the "Space Invaders" classic arcade game.

This game was initially developed for a presentation at [OSCON Open Source Software Superstream Series: Live Codingâ€”Go, Rust, and Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/oscon-open-source-software-superstream-series-live-codinggo-rust-and-python/0636920410188/) and then adapted for inclusion as an example project for the 2020 version of [Ultimate Rust Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/?referralCode=AF30FAD8C6CCCC2C94F0).  The tags `part-1`, `part-2`, etc. correspond to the various stages of the original presentation.

Since the original presentations, folks continue to tinker and improve the game. Feel free to fork this repository, make a change, and submit a pull request if you have a good idea!
